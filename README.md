# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### axum + yew + shuttle codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://realworld-axum-yew-shuttle.shuttleapp.rs/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **axum + yew + shuttle** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **axum + yew + shuttle** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

The backend is written with [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), the frontend is written with [Yew](https://yew.rs/), and deployment is done by [shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/). The database is PostgreSQL and is manipulated by [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx). Queries are checked for correctness at compile time. The front end is built as a SPA using Yew and compiled as a wasm. Data is fetched using [reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/). JWT tokens are generated by [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/Keats/jsonwebtoken) and passwords are hashed in argon2 by [password_hash](https://github.com/RustCrypto/traits/tree/master/password-hash) with salt.

# Getting started

## Compile frontend

First, install [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/)

```sh
$ cargo install --locked trunk
```

And then, compile using trunk.

```sh
$ cd frontend
$ trunk build --release
```

Copy `dist` directory to backend directory.

```sh
$ cp -r dist ../backend
```

## Compile backend

First, install `cargo-shuttle`

```sh
$ cargo install cargo-shuttle
```

To run locally:

```sh
$ cd backend
$ cargo shuttle run
```

To deploy to shuttle server:

```sh
$ cd backend
$ cargo shuttle project new --name {name-of-app}
$ cargo shuttle deploy
```
